You're creating a discount calculator for a store. 
Given an array of item prices, calculate and print the discounted price for each item. 
Apply a 10% discount to items priced at or above $50 and a 5% discount to all other items.

Print out a message indicating the original price and the new price of the item.

Example input: [70, 25, 50, 10]

Example output:
Original price: $70, Discount price: $63
Original price: $25, Discount price: $23.75
Original price: $50, Discount price: $45
Original price: $10, Discount price: $9.50

You're going to build a vowel counter. 
Given a string, count and print out the number of vowels in the string.
